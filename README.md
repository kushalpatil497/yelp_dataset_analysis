2. Use **`Split_Files.ipynb`** (a Python Jupyter Notebook created in Anaconda) to split the large JSON files into manageable chunks.
3. **Upload** the split files to your AWS **S3 bucket**.
4. Generate **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** for your **IAM User** on AWS.
5. Execute the setup and transformation queries provided in the **`Snowflake Queries/`** folder.
6. Perform data analysis tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, top users, review insights) using the SQL scripts in the same folder.
